I choosed the MIT Licence because its simple and flexible and easy to use in software projects.
The MIT License is a permissive open-source license widely used in software projects 
due to its simplicity and flexibility. It allows users to freely use, modify, and 
distribute the software for any purpose, including commercial use, without imposing 
significant restrictions or requiring derivative works to be open source. 
This permissiveness fosters collaboration and integration of code across projects 
but also poses risks of misuse and potential fragmentation of the project's community.
While it offers minimal liability for the original author and promotes widespread adoption, 
developers should carefully consider the balance between openness and control
when choosing the MIT License for their projects.
